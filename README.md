# Module: Soccer Calendar

The 'SOCCERCAL' module is a costum module of the MagicMirror. The idea was to connect to the a calendar webpage published on Sainte Anne de Lachine and extract two specific teams.

The module will display the upcoming games for those 2 teams.

Users can use this module to experiment a few things on MagicMirror:
- Use of the sendNotification function
- Get data from a web URL through Pyton
- Update the data on some frequency
